# E-commerce Return Prediction System

## Overview
This project is an advanced machine learning-powered analytics platform designed to make online shopping smoother and more satisfying for customers. By predicting product returns, analyzing return reasons, and detecting bracketing behavior, the system helps ensure that customers receive products that meet their expectations, experience fewer hassles with returns, and enjoy a more personalized shopping journey. Built with Streamlit, Scikit-learn, and AutoGluon, it also provides retailers with insights to optimize their services, but the primary focus is on enhancing the end-customer experience.

## Real-World Use & Customer Experience Enhancement
- **Return Probability Prediction:** Helps customers by reducing the likelihood of receiving products they might want to return, thanks to smarter recommendations and proactive support.
- **Return Reason Analysis:** Identifies common issues leading to returns, enabling businesses to address them quickly so customers get better products and service.
- **Bracketing Detection:** Ensures fair return policies and a smoother process for genuine customers, while discouraging practices that can lead to delays or complications.

By leveraging these insights, the system enables:
- Faster and more accurate support for customer concerns.
